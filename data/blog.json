        "content": "Midari is a character with masochistic and suicidal tendencies, which is stated obviously in one of the chapters in the manga in which she stabs her own eye with an ink pen out to pay off the debt to the president. She is shown to be very persistent and overbearing, intimidating or being weird to the other students, such as when playing a sadistic game of life or death with Yumeko Jabami. She is also very impulsive and has little self-restraint, causing her to look more at immediate satisfaction than any long-term consequences.",
